## WEEK 1: Introduction to Pytorch

On the first week it is implemented a model, done at first with keras, using pytorch. The model created should be able to classify landscapes images into 8 different classes such as, coast, forest, mountain, and so on.

The model built is called Pokenet which is simple, fast and efficient. This model has 4 convolutional layers and at the end an average pooling that helps to reduce the number of parameters.

## WEEK 2: Introduction to Object Detection

On this second week it is implemented an object detector algorithm usind Detectron2. In the code there are 3 options, first of all, when the model is not trained that could be run the code using Faster R-CNN or using RetinaNet. On the other hand, when the model is trained using Kitti dataset where the code is run with Faster R-CNN.
