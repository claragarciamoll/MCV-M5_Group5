## PROJECT 1:

On the first project it is implemented a model, done at first with keras, using pytorch. The model created should be able to classify landscapes images into 8 different classes such as, coast, forest, mountain, and so on.

The model built is called Pockenet which is simple, fast and efficient. This model has 4 convolutional layers and at the end an average pooling that helps to reduce the number of parameters.
