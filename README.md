## WEEK 1: Introduction to Pytorch

On the first week it is implemented a model, done at first with keras, using pytorch. The model created should be able to classify landscapes images into 8 different classes such as, coast, forest, mountain, and so on.

The model built is called Pokenet which is simple, fast and efficient. This model has 4 convolutional layers and at the end an average pooling that helps to reduce the number of parameters.

## WEEK 2: Introduction to Object Detection

On this second week it is implemented an object detector algorithm using Detectron2. In the code there are 3 options, first of all, when the model is not trained that could be run the code using Faster R-CNN or using RetinaNet. On the other hand, when the model is trained using Kitti dataset where the code is run with Faster R-CNN.

## WEEK 3: Introduction to M5 Project: Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS)

On this third week it is implemented the methods to solve two challenges proposed on CVPR 2020 workshop (https://motchallenge.net/workshops/bmtt2020/tracking.html).
The first challenge is based on pedestrians tracking and segmentation, while the second challenge is to track and segmentate not only pedestrians, but also cars. In order to achieve both challenges two datasets are given, the first one is callet MOTSChallenge whereas the second one is called KITTI-MOTS and two models are used, the Faster R-CNN and the RetinaNet using Detectron2 as in previous week.

## WEEK 4: Introduction to Object Segmentation

On this fourth week it is implemented an image instance segmentation algorithm using Detectron2. In the code there are many options that let us to use different models from COCO that uses the Mask R-CNN with different backbone combinations such as:
* ResNet50-FPN: Use a ResNet50+FPN with standard convolutional layers and FC heads for mask and box prediction.
* ResNet101-FPN: Use a ResNet101+FPN with standard conv layers and FC heads for mask and box prediction. 
* ResNeXt101-FPN: Use a ResNeXt101+FPN with standard conv and FC heads for mask and box prediction.
* R50-C4: Use a ResNet50 conv4 backbone with conv5 head.
* R101-C4: Use a ResNet101 conv4 backbone with conv5 head.
* R50-DC5: Use a ResNet50 conv5 backbone with dilations in conv5, and standard conv and FC heads for mask and box prediction.
* R101-DC5: Use a ResNet101 conv5 backbone with dilations in conv5, and standard conv and FC heads for mask and box prediction.
* Cityscapes: Use Mask R-CNN on Cityscapes instance segmentation

Moreover there are more options such as, using the pretrained models or train the model using our own dataset, which is KITTI-MOTS dataset. There is the option to choose different thresholds, different learning rates and different learning rate schedulers such as:
* WarmupMultiStepLR
* WarmupCosineLR

On the slides below there are some results obtained usind some different options mentioned before.
